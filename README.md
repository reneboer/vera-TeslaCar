# vera-TeslaCar
Vera plugin for Vera and openLuup to control your Tesla with same commands as the mobile app, like Charging control, open/close locks, doors, windows, etc.

# No longer working!!!
Tesla changed to logon and I need to update the code. Will be updated as soon as I can.

You can find the full instructins in the [Wiki](https://github.com/reneboer/vera-TeslaCar/wiki).

Some to-do's
 * Smart preheat function.

If you have more suggestions you can open an issue, or post on the [Vera Community pages](https://community.getvera.com/t/plugin-tesla-car-integration/212184).
