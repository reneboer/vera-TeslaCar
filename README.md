# Tesla API will stop in 2024, so will this plugin!
Tesla is stopping the current Rest API this plugin is based on this means this plugin will stop working in the course of this year. As I no longer own a Tesla there is nothing I can do to keep this working. You can find some discussion on possible alternatives here https://github.com/alandtse/tesla/issues/743.

# vera-TeslaCar
Vera plugin for Vera and openLuup to control your Tesla with same commands as the mobile app, like Charging control, open/close locks, doors, windows, etc.

Now uses an initial refresh token for authentication. This allowes for MFA, and removed issues when Tesla makes changes to login page.

You can find the full instructins in the [Wiki](https://github.com/reneboer/vera-TeslaCar/wiki).

If you have more suggestions you can open an issue, or post on the [Vera Community pages](https://community.getvera.com/t/plugin-tesla-car-integration/212184).
