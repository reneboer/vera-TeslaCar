# vera-TeslaCar
Vera plugin for Vera and openLuup to control your Tesla with same commands as the mobile app, like Charging control, open/close locks, doors, windows, etc.

Now uses an initial refresh token for authentication. This allowes for MFA, and removed issues when Tesla makes changes to login page.

You can find the full instructins in the [Wiki](https://github.com/reneboer/vera-TeslaCar/wiki).

If you have more suggestions you can open an issue, or post on the [Vera Community pages](https://community.getvera.com/t/plugin-tesla-car-integration/212184).
